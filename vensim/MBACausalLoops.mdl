If we want to disable the effect of infrastructure aging, we cannot simply turn of the link from aging to planned infrastructure, since the effect will still be carried because of the increase in infrastructe shortage. Therefore, infrastructure aging should be stopped entirely

The second loop we will disble is the staff availability loop. We think this will greatly influence the results since sensitivity analysis has shown that the model is sensitive  to the staff availability. Staff availability is used in three loops. One which reduces the amount of infrastructure which ca nbe planned, one which reduces the amount of infrastructure which can be built and one which increases the infrastructure aging when less maintenance can be carried out
