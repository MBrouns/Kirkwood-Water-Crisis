The infrastructure system describes the comissioning, decomissioning and maintenance of the water supply system in the kirkwood area. **Theoretical Infrastructure Capacity** is the theoretical maximum the water infrastructure can supply without leakage or pushing it over capacity. The average lifetime of infrastructure is 30 years after which it becomes **Aged Infrastructure** and no longer adds to the water supply capacity. The infrastructure lifetime can be influenced by several factors such as the *percentage infrastructure maintained annually* and how much the infrastructure is pushed over its capacity, which is depicted in the system as the *infrastructure shortage*.
